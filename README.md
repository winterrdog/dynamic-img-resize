# dynamic-img-resize

was testing out `libvips` via sharp to handle dynamic image resizing

# usage

```sh
npm install // install dependencies
npm start // running the program
```

# notes

- `libvips` is a C library for image processing, and sharp is a Node.js wrapper around it
- `libvips` is known for being fast and efficient, especially for large images
- test images are in the [`imgs`](./imgs/) directory, and the output is in the [`out`](./out/) directory
